## this project for what?
When I do something about use  json patch(RFC 7396),   Although,  I found kubernetes kubectl use json patch ,  but it not has a general RFC standard.  So I want  to create this project to  covert strategic json patch to a general RFC standard patch json.  It is convenient for us to adapt  strategic json patch.
